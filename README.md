# LIGO Homework 3 – MyST Site
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UCB-stat-159-f25/hw3-beccaashley/main)

This project reproduces parts of the LIGO Gravitational Wave Event tutorial, including:
- Implementation of `whiten`, `write_wavfile`, `reqshift`, and `plot_spectrogram` utilities.
- Modularization of code into `ligotools/utils.py`.
- Testing of these functions with Pytest.
- A full MyST website built from Jupyter Notebooks.
